# BMI_Calculator

In this project, we are creating BMI Calculator in Python using Jupyter.

BMI calculator is used to calculate your Body Mass Index (BMI).
Body Mass Index, or BMI, is a measurement of body fat based on hheight and weight.

Your BMI (Body Mass Index) is a calculation that is used to determine if a person is overweight that applies to both adult men and women. Although BMI is not perfect because it does not directly assess body fat, it is still considered a reasonable alternative for identifying people who are overweight or obese, since measuring body fat directly is a costly process.

This BMI calculator will give your estimated number. Enter your height and weight below, then click the "Submit" button. If your BMI is above 25, losing weight is a smart idea.
